# Web-Technology
This is for coursework 1 in web technology module
For this project I decided to create a store website that sells dress and t-shirts. And the name of the store is "He and She", this is not popular in Uzbekistan, but I ordered from Tashkent and got two piecesâ€™ shirts of this store. I chose this store because of my main choice, because I want to, also I want to develop. If you want, you can find the store by googling "He and She store". During the building of this store website, I used HTML and CSS. In the first place when you enter the first page there is the whole cover of the page. There is a logo and "Home", "About us" and etc. things. Then you can access to other pages by clicking navigation with the names "Accessories", "Men", "Woman" and "Jewelries". You can access them and find clothes with prices. And then there are some pictures and even lower part there are things that you can also access and the names are "Privacy Policy", "FAQ" and three more. You can move from clickable words to the next pages. There are 14 index_something.html with 14 style_something.css. I started uploading to Github repository a long time ago, and you can see the history from there, also the repository is public, I will provide the links.
The link to the Github repository: https://github.com/00014812/Web-Technology.git
The Actual Website link: https://heandshe.com.au/
This is an netlify link: https://incandescent-salmiakki-1d468e.netlify.app/  (But it is only opening first page)
When I DRAG the index.html, it is working with all of the clickable parts. You can move to the next page, but it is not working in the netlify.
